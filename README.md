# To-Do App

## Description
This is a simple command-line-based To-Do app written in Python. The app allows users to add, edit, view, mark tasks as complete, and exit the program. The tasks are stored in a text file, making it easy to save and retrieve them. This project demonstrates basic file handling, user input, and looping constructs in Python.

## Features
- **Add** a new task to your to-do list.
- **Show** the list of current tasks.
- **Edit** an existing task by entering its number.
- **Mark** a task as complete.
- **Exit** the program.

## How It Works
The app runs in a loop, prompting the user to choose an action from the following options:
- `add`: Add a new to-do item to the list.
- `show`: Display the list of current to-do items.
- `edit`: Edit an existing to-do item.
- `complete`: Mark a to-do item as completed.
- `exit`: Exit the application.
