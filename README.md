# To-Do App with GUI

## Description
This is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** based To-Do app written in Python. The app allows users to add, edit, view, and mark tasks as complete using a user-friendly interface. Tasks are saved to a file, allowing for easy retrieval even after the app is closed. The GUI is implemented using Python's `tkinter` (or whichever GUI library you're using).

## Features
- **Add** a new task to your to-do list through the GUI.
- **Show** all current tasks in the task list.
- **Edit** any existing task.
- **Mark** tasks as complete.
- **Clear** the completed tasks from the list.

## How It Works
Users can interact with the app using buttons and input fields provided in the GUI. The app stores tasks in a file for persistence. You can:

- Add tasks by entering them into an input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- Edit tasks by selecting them from the list and entering new text.
- Mark tasks as complete by selecting them from the list.
- View all current tasks in the app window.
